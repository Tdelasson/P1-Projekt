When opening the file, you have to open it in the src folder, otherwise the program will not work.
This is done most easily by going into the src folder in path finder and opening database.db in your IDE of choice

You need to change your i dea.max.intellisense.filesize=10000 
Is done by (in clion) going to help -> edit custom properties -> paste: idea.max.intellisense.filesize=10000 

## How to run the program
1. Run the program in your IDE of choice
2. Program will ask for "staff ID"
3. Open nursing_home_staff.txt under the folder database_textfiles
4. Find the staff ID you want to log in as
5. The program will now ask for a social security number
5. Then open the file resident_record.txt
6. Choose a social security number which is the final number in each line
