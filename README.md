When opening the file, you have to open it in the src folder, otherwise the program will not work.
This is done most easily by going into the src folder in path finder and opening database.db in your IDE of choice

You need to change your i dea.max.intellisense.filesize=10000 
Is done by (in clion) going to help -> edit custom properties -> paste: idea.max.intellisense.filesize=10000
